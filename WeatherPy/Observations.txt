1.  The citites in the southern hemisphere have less wind speed than  the cities in the northern hemisphere.
	In addition, there are more cities identified in the northern hemisphere than in the southern.
2.  Among the southern hemisphere, the lower the latitiude the higher the max temp.  This is of course in contrast
	with the northern hemisphere that shows the max temp lower as the latitude positioning increases.
3.  Lastly, when observing the scatter plots between cities with respect to humidity and cloudiness, we see that
	cloudiness is pretty evenly spread among the cities with varing humidity levels.  However, the greater
	the humidity, the higher the cloudiness.
